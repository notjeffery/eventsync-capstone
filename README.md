# EventSync (Capstone Project)

## Description
EventSync is an events discovery and coordination app that helps users find events near them, track their favorite artists, and plan attendance with friends.  

The project is being built step by step, with a focus on **mobile-first design**, responsive UI, and a smooth user flow from onboarding to event exploration.
