# EventSync (Capstone Project)

## Description
EventSync is an events discovery and coordination app that helps users find events near them, track their favorite artists, and plan attendance with friends.

## Features (Planned)
- Splash screen with branding
- Onboarding & interest selection
- Event feed (Explore, Following, For You)
- Event details with interactions
- Friends & group coordination

## Tech Stack
- React (Vite) + Tailwind CSS

## Setup
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the app



## Notes
Tailwind config (tailwind.config.js) and PostCSS were added manually since npx tailwindcss init -p didnâ€™t work on Git Bash.
