EventSync (Capstone Project)
## Description

EventSync is an events discovery and coordination app that helps users find events near them, track their favorite artists, and plan attendance with friends.

This project is being built step by step.

Currently, the Hero Page and Interest Page have been implemented.

## Current Progress

Interest Page

Event category options (Sports, Music, Tech, etc.) remain as selectable buttons

Improved spacing between Artist and Event Category sections for better readability
